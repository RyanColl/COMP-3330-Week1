## Getting Started With My Project!

### Week 1

In week 1, we discussed the basics of React. I want to introduce to you a project that I am doing for COMP-3330 in week 1. I am going to build a simple app that uses typescript, a ternary oporator, state, and a button to change dark theme to light theme!

#### Typescript

Typescript is involved in the project, but do not worry, simply using npm install when you enter the project solves any sort of dependency problems.

#### Ternary

Ternary operator is used to check a condition that returns a boolean, and then executes code based on whether it is true or false.
